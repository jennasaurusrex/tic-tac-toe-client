## PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT:
This project was really fun for me! I thought I had the entire project mapped out before beginning, but it proved challenging in many ways I hadn't expected. I had planned on beginning with my game logic, but it ended up being the last piece of information that I worked on because I realized I needed a visual representation of my website before I could delve into the logic of it. I initially thought to use an algorithm to invoke wins or tie games on my game client, but quickly found some huge holes in my thinking. Leading into what I plan on editing in the future...

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
I would like to edit my game logic to be more DRY.
Fix button bug.
